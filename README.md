# LRU Cache in C++

## ðŸ“˜ About the Project
This project implements an *LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache* in C++ using:
- A *hash table* for constant-time lookups
- A *custom doubly linked list* to maintain access order  

Both get() and put() operations run in *O(1)* time.

## âœ¨ Features
- Efficient cache replacement policy
- Automatic eviction of least-recently used items
- Clean object-oriented design
- Demonstrates practical integration of *DSA concepts*
